# Course 2 Project - Jake Young - 4 Days

## Overview of Development
The project took me longer to complete than I initially anticipated as I ran into a few problems. The first of which was that the app would crash everytime I opened it on my phone. To fix this, I had to create a brand new scene in the version of Unity I was using (5.6.1f1) and import all assets and packages over. From then I progressed fairly quickly and got to the final stage of animating the globe. Here I spent majority of the time trying to fix a problem which was down to a simple naming issue. I found the answer on the forums as someone was having the same issue. In the trigger animation component I was entering the name of my animation into the aniamtion name. I never realised and learned that the trigger animation script requires the name of the trigger not the animation. Also, regarding the compression of the lightmaps, I tried both. Neither created any artifacts but the compressed lightmap when baked looked very pixelated and so I decided to go with uncompressed. I removed the teleportaion from the scene as well as I did not think it made sense to teleport and affect the globe's rotation with one click, it would quickly become very disorientating for the user. 

## What I liked about this project
- Getting to create your own scene from scratch and make it unique.
- Learning how to animate and create interaction between it and the user. 

## What was challenging 
- Trying to figure out the best placement for lighting and the intensity of each light to best suit the scene. 




### GVR Version
